# memento
External memory for introverts

Memento runs on your phone or your computer and lets you keep track of your 
relatives information (such as birthdates), or life events (like a new job or moving abroad).
You can also keep track of your social interactions with them (last time you had a drink with your best friend).

Then you can define how often you want to be reminded to check on others like:
- "your best friend birthday is next month, do you want to plan something for the occasion?"
- "you haven't called your mom for 2 weeks, do you want to call her now or later today?"
- "your told me your cousin's would graduate today, want to send him a text to ask how it went?"

These days, people use big platforms such as Facebook to remind them of these things, and as a consequence, 
become dependent on these platforms.

The goal is to bring you back in control of your data. 
Memento uses encrypted local storage with PIN code to store your data on your phone, and nothing is ever sent over the network.
